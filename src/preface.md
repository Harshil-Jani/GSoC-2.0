# Preface

Google summer of code is an annual open source coding program and I am obliged to get selected for this, twice in consecutive years. But throughout reading the entire book, Please keep in mind about the fact that Open Source and Computer Science is the real big picture. All the things of which you would be thinking would matter are just a part of small pool. This does not make anyone more or less previlaged than other who was not into such places.

Last Year, I have crafted a journey book which reflected my work, project and daily deeds and efforts with it. I don't know how many people read it or even if that helped or not. But, what I have found is a factor for personal growth and memories. It worked as a diary where I just flushed out my feelings. I never thought to craft any of my documentation work in public interest and this at some times feels so wrong. So, After all the nitty gritty learnings, I can assure that 

- I won't repeat some mistakes into this book.
- People will actually learn a concept or project irrespective of who I am.
- The sole purpose should be to embrace the technicality of the project and not "Harshil Jani".
- Making newbies into open source comfortable in believing that it is not that hard to learn tons of things at a time.

With such self observations, I am starting this officially dated on 14th May 2023.

## Side Notes

I am definately trying to make it minimalistic but there is something which I left as a child and now a days, I am again in love with the sport. It is all about WWE. So, You may find some sarcasms around the topic since, I am a huge fan and would give a tribute to my younger self for sticking with such a sport. I don't want to get on a debate of whether it is fake or real, But all I know is that as a kid, It helped me shape my personality in such a manner that I am bound to believe that all the meta-skills which I am possessing are the outcomes of being a WWE Fan.

I at some places would love to claim the analogy of WWE 2 Times Heavyweight Championship taking a name of a wrestler whose ring name was "AJ Styles" and mutate it a little bit to "HJ Styles" which I used to call myself and even had a blog and youtube channel under same name(All deleted).
