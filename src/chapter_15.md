# Closing Notes

This marks the completion of my Google Summer of Code 2023 project. With all the project work and the conferences I have been part of, I am thankful to my mentor who have helped me in each stage to achieve better success.

As an individual, I have evolved a lot as a different person which stormy winds flowing through my life span. But towards the end it was all worth it since I found things that gave me the correct direction and purpose [Not talking about Career]. 

I am happy that this GSoC project was not another bro project which was just out there for playing around and checking that if it works then it works else leave. This was a project which I started with very little knowledge but gained massive insights of various concepts. Being from a non computer science domain, I got to learn and apply core concepts which my peers never even talk about.

The best achievement in open source world in my life is that "I wrote the world's first Matrix Bridge in Rust which made it to Production." And We were invited my `Matrix Community` to showcase our work.

I would urge developers to focus on FOSS principles and keep the source code as open as possible since the growth in computer science is research oriented and that's the main reason it has the term 'science' in it. Life is too short to earn money from code. Prefer farming, cooking, gardening, plumbing etc. to earn side money but for sake of FOSS please do not write proprietary codes.

Cheers and Regards
